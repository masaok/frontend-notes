### useEffect fires on page load even though dependency never changed

When you use `useEffect` in React, it's designed to run after every render by default, including the initial render. That's why your `useEffect` hook fires on page load. The dependency array at the end of the `useEffect` call is what controls when it fires after the initial render. If the dependency array:

- Is not provided, the effect runs after every render.
- Is an empty array `[]`, the effect runs once after the initial render, mimicking `componentDidMount`.
- Contains variables or props, the effect runs when those dependencies change, mimicking `componentDidUpdate`.

If you're seeing `useEffect` fire for updates you did not expect, it might be due to one or more of the following reasons:

1. **Changes to Dependencies**: If any variable or object in the dependency array changes, `useEffect` will run. Remember, objects and arrays are compared by reference in JavaScript, not by value. So, if an object or array dependency is recreated on every render, it will cause the effect to run again.

2. **Incorrect Dependency Array**: Ensure that all variables used inside `useEffect` that may change over time are included in the dependency array. Missing dependencies can cause stale closures, leading to bugs.

3. **Empty or No Dependency Array**: If your intention is not to run `useEffect` on every render or only once on mount, check your dependency array. An empty array `[]` ensures it runs only once, while no dependency array means it runs on every render.

4. **State/Props Changes**: If your dependency is a prop or state value that might change as a result of parent component re-rendering or state changes within the component, `useEffect` will run.

To debug and solve this:

- **Double-check your dependency array** for correctness. Make sure it includes all variables and props that are used inside the effect and might change.
- **Optimize object/array dependencies**: If an object or array is recreated on every render, consider using `useMemo` or `useState` to keep its reference stable unless it actually needs to change.
- **Functional updates for state**: If you're setting state based on the previous state inside `useEffect`, ensure you're using functional updates to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

If you have a specific scenario in mind, feel free to share more details, such as the `useEffect` code snippet, so I can offer more tailored advice.

### Do all useEffects fire at the same time on first page load?

Yes, all `useEffect` hooks will run after the initial render of your component, but they don't necessarily fire "at the same time" in the synchronous sense. React's rendering and effect execution model is a bit more nuanced:

1. **Rendering Phase**: During this phase, React goes through its virtual DOM to determine what changes need to be made to the actual DOM. This is a purely synchronous process. All your components that are due for an update will be rendered during this phase.

2. **Commit Phase**: After React has determined the changes, it updates the actual DOM. This is still part of the synchronous rendering process. Once the DOM has been updated, React will then proceed to the next phase, where it runs the effects.

3. **Effects Execution**: `useEffect` hooks are run after the DOM has been updated. This is often referred to as being "asynchronous" because it does not happen within the main rendering flow; however, it's better to think of it as "deferred" until after the paint. React will run all the `useEffect` hooks in the order they were declared in your components. So, while they all start after the initial render, they run sequentially, not in parallel or "at the same time."

   - Effects in parent components will run before effects in child components, following the order of component rendering.
   - If multiple `useEffect` hooks are declared within the same component, they are executed in the order they are defined.

4. **Cleanup and Dependencies**: If a `useEffect` returns a cleanup function, that cleanup is called before the component unmounts or before the effect runs again due to its dependencies changing. The dependencies array controls if and when a particular effect should rerun after the initial execution.

React ensures that the effects are run after the paint, so you don't see any flickering or intermediate states on the screen. This model provides a predictable execution pattern for side effects, separate from the rendering process, allowing for efficient updates and a smooth user experience.
