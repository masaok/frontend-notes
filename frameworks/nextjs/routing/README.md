In Next.js, whether routing to a new path causes all components to re-mount depends on several factors, including the structure of your components, the way you've set up your pages, and how you use keys in your components. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

### Basic Routing Behavior in Next.js

Next.js uses a file-based router built on the concept of pages. When you navigate between pages (i.e., different files in the `/pages` directory), Next.js automatically handles the routing:

1. **Full Page Transitions**: By default, navigating to a new page path in Next.js causes a full page transition where the current page component is unmounted and the new page component is mounted. This is true for transitions between different paths (e.g., from `/about` to `/contact`).

2. **Component-Level Persistence**: If you want to persist state or avoid re-mounting components unnecessarily, you might need to lift state up to a common ancestor or use global state management tools like Redux or Context API.

### Optimizations and Exceptions

- **Shallow Routing**: Next.js offers an option for shallow routing, where the URL changes but the page does not undergo a full reload if the page being navigated to is the same as the current page. This can be useful for cases where you want to change the URL path or query while retaining the state of the page.

- **Using `key` Property**: If components in your pages use the `key` property based on the route, changes in the route might cause components to re-mount if their keys change.

- **Dynamic Routes with getStaticProps/getServerSideProps**: Components on pages that utilize dynamic routes and fetch data using `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` will remount when navigating to a new route parameter to fetch new data associated with the new route.

### Example Scenarios

1. **Navigating Between Pages (`/about` to `/services`)**:

   - Both the `About` and `Services` page components will mount and unmount completely upon navigation.

2. **Navigating Within the Same Page (Query Parameter Changes)**:

   - If using shallow routing, the same component might not remount, and React will only re-render if necessary (e.g., changing from `/dashboard?month=January` to `/dashboard?month=February` without a page reload).

3. **Component Keys Based on Path**:
   - If a component inside these pages uses a key that depends on the path, changing paths will cause this component to remount.

### Conclusion

Generally, in Next.js, routing to a new path at the page level will cause components to re-mount as it involves a full page transition. However, this can be managed or optimized using shallow routing, keys, or persistent state management depending on the specific needs and setup of your application. For deeper component trees, re-mounting behavior can also depend significantly on how you structure your component keys and manage state.
