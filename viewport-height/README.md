### How to get viewport height in a mobile web browser

To create a custom React hook in Next.js with TypeScript for tracking the viewport height, you can follow this example. This hook will allow you to dynamically obtain the viewport height, which updates on window resize events. It's particularly useful for responsive designs or when you need to adjust your layout based on the viewport size.

Here's how you could implement such a hook:

```typescript
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

// Custom hook name useViewportHeight
const useViewportHeight = (): number => {
  // State to store the viewport height
  const [height, setHeight] = useState<number>(0);

  // Handler to update the viewport height
  const updateHeight = () => {
    setHeight(window.innerHeight);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    // Set initial height
    updateHeight();

    // Add resize event listener to update the height when the viewport changes
    window.addEventListener("resize", updateHeight);

    // Clean up the event listener on component unmount
    return () => window.removeEventListener("resize", updateHeight);
  }, []); // Empty dependency array means this effect runs once on mount

  return height;
};

export default useViewportHeight;
```

### How to Use This Hook in Your Next.js Components

To use this custom hook in a Next.js component, you first need to import it at the top of your component file. Then, you can call `useViewportHeight` to get the current viewport height and use this value as needed within your component.

Here's a basic example of how to use the `useViewportHeight` hook in a functional component:

```typescript
import React from "react";
import useViewportHeight from "./path/to/useViewportHeight"; // Adjust the path based on your file structure

const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const viewportHeight = useViewportHeight();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>The viewport height is: {viewportHeight}px</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

This hook provides a flexible way to access and react to changes in the viewport height, enhancing the responsiveness and adaptability of your web application.
